INTRODUCTION

-->3C Parking Solution is for managing the records of the incoming and outgoing vehicles in an parking house.

--> As we all know that the world is fighting Covid-19 pandemic, we are here to design and develop a 3-C parking solution for colleges and schools. There is a crucial problem of vehicle parking in these areas. The vehicle parking area has many lanes/slots for car parking. So to park a vehicle one has to look for all the lanes. Moreover this involves a lot of manual labour and investment. Instead of vehicle caught in towing the vehicle can park on safe and security with low cost.

--> The objective of this project is to build a Vehicle Parking management system without any sensors that enables the time management and control of vehicles by scanning QR code of user .The system that will track the entry and exit of vehicles, maintain a listing of vehicles within the parking lot, and determine if the parking lot is full or not and it will will automatically show the nearsest available parking spot for the convenience of the user without any human contact.

Technology Used :-

Python : Python is a popular, interpreted, high-level programming language which is widely used. Python is a general-purpose programming language hence, python-based projects are used for developing both desktop and web applications.

Spyder : Spyder is an Integrated Development Environment. This means it combines many features associated with programming tasks, including: the editing of text files, the execution of code in a shell1, the preview of figures created by your code, and much more. Therefore, IDEs are very useful for programming

Tkinter : This framework provides Python users with a simple way to create GUI elements using the widgets found in the Tk toolkit. Tk widgets can be used to construct buttons, menus, data fields, etc. in a Python application.

OpenCV : It is a cross-platform library using which we can develop realtime computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.

SqLite : It allows a single database connection to access multiple database files simultaneously. This brings many nice features like joining tables in different databases or copying data between databases in a single command. SQLite is capable of creating in-memory databases that are very fast to work with.

Twilio API : Twilio's APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) power its platform for communications. Behind these APIs is a software layer connecting and optimizing communications networks around the world to allow your users to call and message anyone, globally. Twilio has a whole host of APIs, from SMS to Voice to Wireless!

Pyqrcode : The pyqrcode module is a QR code generator that is simple to use and written in pure python. The module is compatible with Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.x. The module automates most of the building process for you. Generally, QR codes can be created using only two lines of code!

CryptoGraphy : Used 'Veigere's Cipher' to Provide Security in the QR Codes Generated.

This Project contains two phases:-

Admin Control (Backend) :- This is a GUI Desktop application, In which the admin will take the Necessary input Details from the user, and fill this information in the dialogue box, and app will automatically validate it and will send two Specific QR codes(Encrypted) to the user to their respective E-mail id provided by the user.

User End Scanner ( Frontend ) :- This Desktop application will Use a webcam to scan the QR code, Validate the user and perform actions like allotting a slot, notify user etc and the action of this phase admin will see on their desktop window and user will be notified via speakers(text to speech).
